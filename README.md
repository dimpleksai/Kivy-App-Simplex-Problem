# Kivy-App-Simplex-problem
This application solves problems of the following type of equations:<br/>
    ax1 + bx2 = z .........(1)<br/>
    a1x1 + b1x2 <= c1......(2)<br/>
    a2x1 + b2x2 <= c2......(3)<br/>
    x1 >= 0<br/>
    x2 >= 0<br/>
  
The equations (2),(3) are the constraints (hence the number of constaints should be filed in the application as 2 for this case).<br/>
The products are x1,x2.<br/> 
The second screen of the application requires to enter any names to the constraints in order to differentiate them from each other.<br/>
The third screen grid needs to be filled as follows:<br/>
    row1 ---> (a,b,0)<br/>
    row2 ---> (a1,b1,c1)<br/>
    row3 ---> (a2,b2,c2)<br/>
    
(In case the output on the final grid is not visible, just maximize the application window)<br/>
